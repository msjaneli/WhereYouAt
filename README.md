# Orange Final Project: wy@
Group members: Sam Chan, Jane Li, Akshara Anand, Neha Kota, Rachel Ma

## Description 
wy@ (Where You At) is an iOS app designed to make casual meet-ups easier. wy@ is focused on ease-of-access, allowing friends to communicate simple messages like invitations and statuses at the press of a button. With wy@, meeting up is as easy as checking your phone, and clicking a button. No more logistics, no more repetive messaging, just hanging out!
## Features 
###### Map
Displays user's location and status along with the locations/status of all the user's added friends

###### Status
Users can choose from 3 listed statuses (free, studying, or busy) to display with their location. Might be expanded to allow for custom messages to be displayed alongside the status.

###### Guide
A guide to the app explaining the features and how to navigate it

###### Add Friends: 
Allows user to invite friends to share their location by searching through the registered users. 

###### Events (stretch goal)
Capability for users to schedule events (ex: going to the gym) and send notifications to their friends to join them.
## Audience
We are aiming to target teens, college students and young adults located in more urban areas with this app. This demographic would be the most engaged in the social media component of the app and interested seeing their social network's location for a quick meet-up or chat.

## Rationale

The reason we chose to design this app is because we saw a found a need for a more social "Find Your Friends" type of app. Instead of an app like "Find my Friends" that is more of a functional use, we wanted to integrate a social component as well and actively encourage users to find where each other are and _physically_ interact with each other.
